Frontend of Construction Buddy, app that will help you to track current building material prices, from three home improvement store chains in Poland.

Main purpose of app is to help gather and update information about various construction materials. 

To run the app you have to provide valid Open Route Service (https://openrouteservice.org/) API key into config.ts file. 
It's free of charge and you can login using GitHub credentials.

This is my private project that I want to use during construction of my house.

TODO functionalities:
- get directions to shops with fuel prices (Shopping List), move this functionality from Calculator component

TODO later and not so easy:
- gather information about availability of products in stores.
